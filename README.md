### `react todo app`

In this todo app user can add the task and description about it.  
The user can start or end once it is done. And user can view, edit, delete the contents of the particular todo anytime.

Firebase is used as a backend server so the you have to login to firebase and create a new server -> click on the Realtime database option -> create database -> test mode. Now copy the url that has been create for you and paste that in 'hooks' folder -> usehttp.js inside you will find the variable 'firebase_url'. check wether url ends with the '/' or not if there is '/' in the end of the url please remove it

### `what is the benefit of this app`

well this todo app is build with different react concepts such as

1. react useState hook
2. react useEffect hook
3. react useContext API hook
4. react useReducer hook
5. react Custom hooks
6. Using Redux
7. connecting to the backend (firebase server)

So one can learn most of the react from this app
